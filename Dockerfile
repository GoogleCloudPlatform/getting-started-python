# The Google App Engine python runtime is Debian Jessie with Python installed
# and various os-level packages to allow installation of popular Python
# libraries. The source is on github at:

FROM gcr.io/google_appengine/python

# Create a virtualenv for the application dependencies.
# If you want to use Python 3, add the -p python3.4 flag.
RUN virtualenv /env

# Set virtualenv environment variables. This is equivalent to running
# source /env/bin/activate. This ensures the application is executed within
# the context of the virtualenv and will have access to its dependencies.
ENV VIRTUAL_ENV /env
ENV PATH /env/bin:$PATH

# Install dependencies.
ADD requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r /app/requirements.txt

# Add application code.
ADD . /app

# [START entrypoint]
# Instead of using gunicorn directly, we'll use Honcho. Honcho is a python port
# of the Foreman process manager. $PROCESSES is set by app.yaml / worker.yaml
# to control which processes Honcho will start.
CMD honcho start -f /app/procfile $PROCESSES
