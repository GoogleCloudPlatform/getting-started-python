# Create a virtualenv for the application dependencies.
# If you want to use Python 2, add the -p python2.7 flag.
RUN virtualenv -p python3.4 /env

# Set virtualenv environment variables. This is equivalent to running
# source /env/bin/activate. This ensures the application is executed within
# the context of the virtualenv and will have access to its dependencies.

# Install dependencies.
ADD requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt

# Instead of using gunicorn directly, we'll use Honcho. Honcho is a python port
# of the Foreman process manager. $PROCESSES is set in the pod manifest
# to control which processes Honcho will start.
